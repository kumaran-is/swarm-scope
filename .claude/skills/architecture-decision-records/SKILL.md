Use when making any significant or irreversible technical decision (framework selection, API design, database schema, infrastructure choice) to ensure every option considered and trade-off made is permanently documented before implementation begins."

**Iron Law:** Every significant technical decision must produce an ADR before implementation begins; never let irreversible decisions proceed without a documented record.

# Architecture Decision Records

Capture the context and rationale behind significant technical decisions using structured ADR formats.

## When to Use This Skill

| Write ADR                  | Skip ADR               |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| New framework adoption     | Minor version upgrades |
| Database technology choice | Bug fixes              |
| API design patterns        | Implementation details |
| Security architecture      | Routine maintenance    |
| Integration patterns       | Configuration changes  |

## Implicit Trigger Detection

Recognize these conversation patterns as ADR signals — ask "Should we document this as an ADR?" before proceeding:

| Signal Pattern | Example | ADR Category |
|----------------|---------|-------------|
| "I need X for Y" | "I need a message queue for async jobs" | Technology choice |
| "Should we use X or Y?" | "Should we use Kafka or BullMQ?" | Technology choice |
| "We're switching from X to Y" | "Moving from REST to GraphQL for..." | Architecture pattern |
| "How should we structure X?" | "How should we structure our auth layer?" | Architecture pattern |
| "We decided to use X" | "We're going with Prisma for the ORM" | Technology choice |
| "X isn't scaling, we need to Y" | "Our monolith isn't scaling, thinking microservices" | Architecture pattern |
| Adding a new external service | Integrating Stripe, adding Firebase Auth | Infrastructure |
| Changing data model significantly | "Users now need multi-tenant support" | Data modeling |

**Rule:** If the decision affects more than one service, involves a new dependency, or cannot easily be reversed — it needs an ADR.

## Quick Start

1. Copy the template: `cp docs/adr/template.md docs/adr/NNNN-your-title.md`
2. Fill in: Context, Decision Drivers, Options, Decision, Consequences
3. PR for review (2+ senior engineers)
4. Update `docs/adr/README.md` index after merge

## Core Concepts

An Architecture Decision Record captures:

- **Context**: Why we needed to make a decision
- **Decision**: What we decided
- **Consequences**: What happens as a result

### ADR Lifecycle

```
Proposed --> Accepted --> Deprecated --> Superseded
                |
             Rejected
```

Read `reference/adr-lifecycle.md` for status transitions, deprecation patterns, and review checklists.

## Process

### 1. Choose a Template

Pick the format that fits the decision's complexity:

| Decision Complexity | Template |
|---------------------|----------|
| Simple tech selection | Y-Statement (one paragraph) |
| Medium decision | Lightweight ADR (0.5-1 page) |
| Significant architecture change | Standard MADR (1-2 pages) |
| Retiring a decision | Deprecation ADR |
| Major cross-team proposal | RFC Style (2-4 pages) |

> **For Standard MADR (significant decisions):** Score each considered option using the dual-lens rubric in `reference/adr-scoring.md` before selecting a winner. Include the `## Option Scoring` table in the ADR. If the winning option is not ADOPT, state mitigations explicitly in the Decision section.

Read `reference/adr-templates.md` for all template formats ready to copy-paste.

### 2. Write the ADR

- Start with context -- explain the problem before the solution
- List 2-3 real alternatives with honest pros/cons and explicit "why not" reasoning (see Alternatives Considered below)
- State the decision clearly
- Document both positive and negative consequences with specifics

### 3. Review and Approve

- Submit as PR with 2+ senior engineer reviewers
- Consult affected teams
- Assess security, cost, and reversibility implications

### 4. Maintain

- Update ADR index after acceptance
- Create implementation tickets
- Never edit accepted ADRs -- write new ones to supersede

Read `reference/adr-examples.md` for complete worked examples (PostgreSQL selection, TypeScript adoption, MongoDB deprecation, event sourcing RFC).

## Alternatives Considered

For each alternative: document pros, cons, AND why it was ultimately rejected.
The "why not" is as valuable as the decision itself — it prevents relitigating the same choices.

| Alternative | Pros | Cons | Why Not Chosen |
|-------------|------|------|----------------|
| Option A | ... | ... | [Specific reason it was rejected for THIS context] |
| Option B | ... | ... | [Specific reason] |

**Rule:** A vague "not chosen" entry (e.g. "too complex") is not acceptable. State the specific constraint, risk, or tradeoff that ruled it out in this context.

## Minimal Template (Copy-Paste Starter)

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: [Title]

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX

## Context
[Why do we need to decide this? What's the problem?]

## Decision
We will [decision].

## Consequences
- **Good**: [benefits]
- **Bad**: [drawbacks]
- **Mitigations**: [how we'll address the bad]
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Writing ADR after implementation | Write during design phase |
| Listing only one option | Always include 2-3 real alternatives |
| Vague consequences | Be specific: "Adds ~200ms latency to checkout" |
| Editing accepted ADRs | Write new ADR that supersedes |
| No decision drivers | List explicit criteria with priorities |
| Missing rejected ADRs | Document rejected options too |

## Error Handling

**Conflicting ADRs**: When a new decision contradicts an existing ADR, create a superseding ADR that explicitly references and deprecates the old one.

**Missing context**: If the decision rationale is unclear or incomplete, flag it and request clarification before recording.
