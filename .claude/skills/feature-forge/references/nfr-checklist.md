# NFR Requirements Checklist

> Load during Phase 2 (Details) or Phase 3 (Edge Cases) of the feature-forge interview.
> Ask NFR questions BEFORE writing the spec — vague NFRs become untestable acceptance criteria.
>
> **Trigger**: Any feature with >100 users, any API endpoint, any shared service, any data-persistence layer.

---

## Overconfidence Prevention

Never accept vague NFR answers. Always follow up:

| Vague Answer | Follow-Up Question | Why |
|-------------|-------------------|-----|
| "it should be fast" | "What is the p95 latency target? For how many concurrent users?" | Untestable without a number |
| "high availability" | "What uptime SLA? 99.9% (8.7h/yr downtime) or 99.99% (52min/yr)?" | Architecture differs significantly |
| "it needs to scale" | "What is the expected load today vs 12 months from now? Orders of magnitude matter." | Horizontal vs vertical scaling choice |
| "it should be secure" | "What data is stored? PII? PCI? PHI? What compliance standard applies?" | Security controls differ by data class |
| "standard logging" | "What retention period? Who needs access to logs? Is this for compliance or debugging?" | Drives infrastructure cost and tooling |
| "should handle failures" | "Define failure: 503 from upstream? DB timeout? Partial write? Recovery time objective?" | Determines retry strategy and circuit breakers |
| "not sure yet" | Stop. Do not proceed. Mark as OPEN NFR — implementation must not start until resolved. | Ambiguous NFRs become unverifiable acceptance criteria |

## NFR Categories

### 1. Performance

**Goal**: Establish measurable latency and throughput targets before implementation.

| Area | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| **Latency** | What is the p50/p95/p99 response time target for this feature? (e.g., API response < 200ms p95) |
| **Throughput** | How many requests per second at peak load? How many concurrent users? |
| **Data volume** | How much data is read/written per operation? Rows, bytes, attachments? |
| **Async vs sync** | Can operations be async (queue + notify) or must they be synchronous end-to-end? |
| **Caching** | Are cache hits acceptable? What is the acceptable staleness window? |

**Tech-stack defaults to confirm or override:**

| Stack | Default | Override Trigger |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Java Spring WebFlux | Reactive, non-blocking. Target: < 100ms p95 for CRUD | Batch jobs, report generation |
| NestJS / Fastify | < 50ms p95 overhead, Fastify serialization on by default | Heavy CPU tasks → offload to worker |
| Python FastAPI | < 200ms p95 for async endpoints | CPU-bound → use Celery/task queue |
| Angular SPA | < 300ms LCP for initial load; < 100ms for interactions | Data-heavy dashboards |
| Flutter mobile | < 16ms frame render (60fps); < 32ms (30fps acceptable) | Background sync, offline-first |

**AskUserQuestions example (latency tier):**

```
Header: "Latency target"
Question: "What response time target should this feature meet?"
Options (single-select):
- "< 100ms p95 — real-time UX (typeahead, live updates)"
- "< 500ms p95 — interactive (form submit, search)"
- "< 2s p95 — acceptable for complex queries"
- "< 10s p95 — background / report generation"
- "Async only — fire-and-forget with notification"
```

---

### 2. Scalability

**Goal**: Determine how load grows and whether the architecture must scale horizontally.

| Area | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| **Current load** | How many users/requests/records today? |
| **Growth projection** | Expected load in 3 months? 12 months? |
| **Traffic pattern** | Steady load or bursty? (e.g., daily batch, event spikes, seasonal peaks) |
| **Horizontal scaling** | Must the feature run as multiple stateless instances? Shared state? Session affinity needed? |
| **Data growth** | How fast does the dataset grow? Will queries degrade as rows increase? |
| **Rate limiting** | Should this feature be rate-limited per user/tenant? What limits? |

**AskUserQuestions example (scale tier):**

```
Header: "Scale expectations"
Question: "What is the expected usage scale for this feature?"
Options (single-select):
- "< 100 users, low frequency — internal tool"
- "100–10K users, moderate frequency — team product"
- "10K–1M users — consumer product, must scale horizontally"
- "> 1M users — high scale, architecture review required"
```

### 3. Availability / Reliability

**Goal**: Establish uptime SLA, failure tolerance, and recovery objectives.

| Area | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| **Uptime SLA** | What uptime is required? 99.9%? 99.95%? 99.99%? |
| **RTO** | Recovery Time Objective — how quickly must the system recover after failure? |
| **RPO** | Recovery Point Objective — how much data loss is acceptable? (e.g., zero, last 5 minutes) |
| **Failover** | Must the feature survive a single-node failure without user impact? |
| **Degraded mode** | If a dependency is unavailable, should the feature degrade gracefully or fail hard? |
| **Scheduled downtime** | Is planned maintenance window acceptable? What window? |

**Quick Reference: SLA Tiers**

| Tier | Uptime | Max Downtime/Month | Typical Use Case |
|------|--------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Standard | 99.9% | 43.8 min | Internal tools, admin panels |
| Business | 99.95% | 21.9 min | Customer-facing APIs |
| High | 99.99% | 4.4 min | Payment flows, auth services |
| Critical | 99.999% | 26 sec | Core infrastructure, safety systems |

**AskUserQuestions example (availability tier):**

```
Header: "Availability requirement"
Question: "What uptime SLA does this feature require?"
Options (single-select):
- "99.9% — standard (< 44 min/month downtime acceptable)"
- "99.95% — business critical (< 22 min/month)"
- "99.99% — high availability (< 5 min/month)"
- "Best effort — internal tool, downtime acceptable"
```

### 4. Security

**Goal**: Identify data sensitivity, authentication, authorization, and compliance requirements.

> For deep security review, dispatch the `security-reviewer` agent after spec is written.

| Area | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| **Data classification** | What data does this feature store or transmit? PII? PCI? PHI? Credentials? |
| **Authentication** | Who can access this feature? Public, authenticated users, specific roles? |
| **Authorization** | Is access role-based (RBAC)? Attribute-based (ABAC)? Per-row/resource? |
| **Input surface** | What user-provided input is accepted? File uploads? URLs? Free text? |
| **Audit trail** | Must access and mutations be logged for compliance? Who reviews logs? |
| **Secrets** | Does this feature need API keys, tokens, or credentials? Where are they stored? |
| **Compliance** | Does this feature fall under GDPR, HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, or local data residency law? |

**AskUserQuestions example (data sensitivity):**

```
Header: "Data sensitivity"
Question: "What category of data does this feature handle? (select all that apply)"
Options (multi-select):
- "PII — names, emails, addresses, phone numbers"
- "Financial — payment methods, transaction amounts"
- "Health — PHI, medical records"
- "Credentials — passwords, API keys, tokens"
- "Non-sensitive — public or anonymized data only"
```

### 5. Observability and Logging

**Goal**: Define what must be logged, traced, and alerted on for this feature.

| Area | Questions |
|------|-----------|
| **Structured logs** | What events must be logged? (request in/out, errors, state transitions, business events) |
| **Distributed tracing** | Does this feature span multiple services? Trace IDs required? |
| **Metrics** | What counters/histograms are needed? (e.g., request rate, error rate, queue depth) |
| **Alerting** | What conditions should trigger a PagerDuty/alert? Error rate threshold? Latency spike? |
| **Log retention** | How long must logs be retained? (compliance may mandate 1–7 years) |
| **Sensitive data in logs** | Are there fields that must be masked or redacted? (PII, tokens) |

**Tech-stack logging standards:**

| Stack | Logging Tool | Standard |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Java Spring | SLF4J + Logback (structured JSON) | Centralized via centralized logger — never `System.out.println` |
| NestJS | NestJS `Logger` (per-module) | Never `console.log` — use Logger service |
| Python FastAPI | `structlog` or `logging` with JSON formatter | Never `print()` |
| Angular | Custom `ErrorHandler` service | Never `console.error` directly |
| Flutter | `logger` package with level filtering | Never `debugPrint` in production |

## NFR Integration with Spec Template

NFR answers must appear as testable acceptance criteria in the spec. Transform answers like this:

| NFR Answer | Acceptance Criterion (EARS format) |
|------------|-----------------------------------|
| "< 500ms p95 response" | WHEN 100 concurrent users submit requests THE SYSTEM SHALL respond within 500ms at the p95 percentile |
| "99.99% uptime" | WHEN a single instance fails THE SYSTEM SHALL failover within 30 seconds without user-visible errors |
| "PII must not appear in logs" | WHEN any request containing user email is logged THE SYSTEM SHALL redact the email field |
| "GDPR right to erasure" | WHEN a user submits a deletion request THE SYSTEM SHALL remove all PII within 30 days |

## AskUserQuestions — NFR Batch Pattern

Group related NFR questions to reduce interview fatigue. Example NFR batch for an API feature:

**Batch 1 — Scale and performance:**
1. "What is the expected concurrent user count at peak load?" (open-ended)
2. "What latency target?" (single-select: < 100ms / < 500ms / < 2s / async)
3. "What uptime SLA?" (single-select: 99.9% / 99.95% / 99.99% / best-effort)

**Batch 2 — Data and compliance:**
4. "What data does this feature store?" (multi-select: PII / financial / health / non-sensitive)
5. "Which compliance standards apply?" (multi-select: GDPR / HIPAA / PCI / SOC2 / none)

**Batch 3 — Operations:**
6. "What failure mode is acceptable?" (single-select: fail-fast / degrade gracefully / queue and retry)
7. "Log retention requirement?" (single-select: 30 days / 1 year / 7 years / unknown)
