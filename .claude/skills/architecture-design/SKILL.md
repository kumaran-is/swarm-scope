**Iron Law:** Never start implementation without an approved architecture plan; always produce API contracts and sequence diagrams before code.

# Architecture Design Skill

Design system architecture, API contracts, deployment topologies, and technology decisions for full-stack applications.

**Supported Design Artifacts:**
- System context diagrams (C4 model, Mermaid)
- Sequence diagrams (service interactions)
- API contracts (OpenAPI 3.x)
- Deployment topologies (Docker Compose)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Process:**

1. **Analyze Request**
   - Identify which artifacts the user needs
   - Determine scope: single service, multi-service, full system

2. **Load Templates**
   - Read [reference/architecture-templates.md](reference/architecture-templates.md) for diagram and deployment templates
   - For detailed ADR workflows: delegate to the `architecture-decision-records` skill
   - For full OpenAPI spec generation: delegate to the `openapi-spec-generation` skill

3. **Generate Artifacts**
   - Use loaded templates as starting points
   - Adapt to the project's tech stack (Spring Boot, Node.js, Angular, Flutter, PostgreSQL, Firebase)
   - Follow conventions from CLAUDE.md (package structure, naming, reactive patterns)

4. **Present and Iterate**
   - Show generated artifacts with explanations
   - Offer refinement options (add services, change patterns, adjust topology)

## Documentation Sources

Before making architecture decisions, consult these sources:

| Source | URL / Tool | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Docker | `https://docs.docker.com/llms.txt` | Container config, Compose, multi-stage builds |
| MCP Protocol | `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt` | MCP integration architecture and patterns |
| All libraries | `Context7` MCP | Latest API references for any technology |

## Error Handling

**Unclear artifact type**: Ask user to specify (diagram, API contract, deployment, ADR).

**Ambiguous tech stack**: Default to project conventions in CLAUDE.md or ask for clarification if multiple options exist.

## Reference Files

| File | When to Load |
|------|-------------|
| [reference/architecture-templates.md](reference/architecture-templates.md) | Always — diagram and deployment templates |
| [reference/context-discovery.md](reference/context-discovery.md) | Before recommending any architecture — gather scale, team, timeline context first |
| [reference/pattern-selection.md](reference/pattern-selection.md) | When choosing between architectural patterns — decision trees per concern |
| [reference/implementation-patterns.md](reference/implementation-patterns.md) | When implementing Clean Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture — Python examples |
| [reference/cloud-service-mapping.md](reference/cloud-service-mapping.md) | GCP-primary cross-cloud service equivalents |

**Load order for new system design:**
1. `context-discovery.md` — classify the project (MVP / SaaS / Enterprise)
2. `pattern-selection.md` — choose the right pattern for the complexity
3. `architecture-templates.md` — generate diagrams and deployment topology
4. `implementation-patterns.md` — if Clean Arch or Hexagonal is chosen
