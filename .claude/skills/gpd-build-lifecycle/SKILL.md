description: Track build processing, upload status, and release management for Google Play using gpd publish commands. Use when uploading an Android AAB, waiting on build processing, checking release state on a track, using internal app sharing for fast distribution, halting a bad rollout, or rolling back a production release. Triggers: "upload AAB", "build lifecycle", "gpd upload", "release status", "internal app sharing", "halt rollout", "rollback release", "gpd build", "track status".

# GPD Build Lifecycle

## Iron Law

**NEVER UPLOAD THE SAME VERSION CODE TWICE — USE A NEW VERSION CODE FOR EVERY BUILD UPLOAD**

Use `gpd publish status` to check the current version code before uploading.

## Upload and validate
```bash
gpd publish upload app.aab --package com.example.app
```

## Inspect release status
```bash
gpd publish status --package com.example.app --track internal
gpd publish status --package com.example.app --track production
```

## Recent tracks and releases
```bash
gpd publish tracks --package com.example.app
```

## Internal app sharing
Use for fast distribution of a build without a full track release.

```bash
gpd publish internal-share upload app.aab --package com.example.app
```

## Cleanup and rollback
```bash
gpd publish halt --package com.example.app --track production --confirm
gpd publish rollback --package com.example.app --track production --confirm
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't upload an AAB without checking the current version code first.** Re-uploading the same version code will be rejected by Google Play; run `gpd publish status --package com.example.app --track internal` before uploading.
- **Don't halt a rollout without reviewing the release status first.** Running `gpd publish halt --confirm` without checking `gpd publish status` risks halting the wrong track or a fully-rolled-out release.
- **Don't use internal app sharing as a substitute for a proper track release.** Internal app sharing bypasses review and track promotion history — use it for smoke tests only, not for beta distribution.

## Verify

After uploading a build:
- Run `gpd publish status --package com.example.app --track internal` and confirm the new version code appears with status `completed` or `draft`.
- After a halt or rollback, run `gpd publish status --package com.example.app --track production` to confirm the release state reflects the change before notifying stakeholders.

## Notes
- Prefer `gpd publish release` for end-to-end flow instead of manual steps.
- Use a new version code for each uploaded build.
