description: End-to-end release workflows for Google Play using gpd publish commands, tracks, staged rollouts, edit lifecycle, and track promotions. Use when uploading an Android AAB to Google Play, publishing to internal/alpha/beta/production tracks, running a staged rollout, promoting between tracks, using the edit lifecycle for multi-step releases, or halting and rolling back a production release. Triggers: "Google Play release", "upload AAB", "gpd publish", "staged rollout", "production release", "promote track", "edit lifecycle", "Play Store release", "internal track", "beta to production".

# Release Flow (Google Play)

## Iron Law

**NEVER RELEASE TO PRODUCTION WITHOUT RUNNING `gpd-submission-health` PREFLIGHT CHECKS AND VALIDATING THE EDIT FIRST**

Always use a new version code per upload. Use `--dry-run` before destructive operations. Run `gpd publish edit validate` before committing.

## Preconditions
- Ensure credentials are set (`GPD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`).
- Use a new version code for each upload.
- Always pass `--package` explicitly.

## Preferred end-to-end commands

### Upload and release to a track
```bash
gpd publish upload app.aab --package com.example.app
gpd publish release --package com.example.app --track internal --status completed
```

### Promote between tracks
```bash
gpd publish promote --package com.example.app --from-track beta --to-track production
```

## Manual sequence with edit lifecycle
Use when you need precise control or multiple changes in one commit.

```bash
# 1. Create edit
EDIT_ID=$(gpd publish edit create --package com.example.app | jq -r '.data.editId')

# 2. Upload build without auto-commit
gpd publish upload app.aab --package com.example.app --edit-id $EDIT_ID --no-auto-commit

# 3. Configure release
gpd publish release --package com.example.app --track internal --status draft --edit-id $EDIT_ID

# 4. Validate and commit
gpd publish edit validate $EDIT_ID --package com.example.app
gpd publish edit commit $EDIT_ID --package com.example.app
```

## Staged rollout
```bash
gpd publish release --package com.example.app --track production --status inProgress --version-code 123
gpd publish rollout --package com.example.app --track production --percentage 5
gpd publish rollout --package com.example.app --track production --percentage 50
gpd publish rollout --package com.example.app --track production --percentage 100
```

## Halt or rollback
```bash
gpd publish halt --package com.example.app --track production --confirm
gpd publish rollback --package com.example.app --track production --confirm
```

## Track status
```bash
gpd publish status --package com.example.app --track production
gpd publish tracks --package com.example.app
```

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't commit an edit without running `gpd publish edit validate` first.** A committed edit with validation errors cannot be reverted — the release will be rejected or published in a broken state.
- **Don't skip staged rollout for production releases.** Releasing directly at 100% leaves no window to catch regressions; always start at 5–10% and monitor before escalating.
- **Don't use `--status completed` on production without running the `gpd-submission-health` preflight.** Skipping the preflight check risks publishing a build that fails Google Play policy review post-release.

## Verify

After each release step:
- Run `gpd publish status --package com.example.app --track <track>` to confirm the release state matches the intended status (`completed`, `inProgress`, `draft`, or `halted`).
- After staged rollout percentage changes, re-run `gpd publish status` and confirm the `userFraction` field reflects the new percentage before moving to the next increment.

## Notes
- Use `--status draft` first for risky releases.
- Use `--confirm` only after reviewing `gpd publish status` output.
