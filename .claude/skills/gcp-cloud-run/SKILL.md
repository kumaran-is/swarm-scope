# GCP Cloud Run

## Iron Law

```
NO CLOUD RUN FUNCTION WITHOUT:
1. A stack-specific health check endpoint (GET /health → 200)
2. GitHub Actions workflow (NEVER cloudbuild.yaml)
3. Workload Identity Federation (NEVER service account JSON keys)
```

## This Skill vs `deployment-engineer` Agent

| Task | Use This Skill | Use `deployment-engineer` Agent |
|------|---------------|---------------------------------|
| Pub/Sub consumer function | YES | No |
| Cloud Storage trigger function | YES | No |
| HTTP webhook / short-lived invocation | YES | No |
| Cold start optimization | YES | No |
| Long-running Cloud Run **service** | No | YES |
| CI/CD pipeline design (service) | No | YES |
| Terraform Cloud Run service module | No | YES (`terraform-specialist`) |

**Key distinction:** Cloud Run **Functions** = event-driven, ephemeral, short-lived invocations.
Cloud Run **Services** = long-running, persistent, serve steady traffic → use `deployment-engineer`.

## Pattern Selector

```
What are you building?
    |
    +-- Pub/Sub consumer, Storage trigger, HTTP webhook?
    |   -> Load: reference/cloud-run-functions.md
    |   -> Pick your stack section (Python, NestJS, Spring Boot, TypeScript/Fastify)
    |
    +-- Cold start is too slow in staging or prod?
    |   -> Load: reference/cold-start-optimization.md
    |   -> Apply flags from the optimization table
    |
    +-- Reviewing existing Cloud Run code or config?
        -> Load: assets/cloud-run-antipatterns.md
        -> Run through checklist before declaring done
```

## Quick Start Checklist

Before writing any Cloud Run Function code:

- [ ] Chose event trigger type: Pub/Sub push | Cloud Storage notification | HTTP
- [ ] Selected target stack: Python FastAPI | NestJS | Spring Boot WebFlux | TypeScript/Fastify
- [ ] Verified runtime version: `python:3.14-slim` | `node:24-alpine` | `eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine`
- [ ] Confirmed port binding: `PORT` env var (Cloud Run injects this, default 8080)
- [ ] Health check endpoint planned: `GET /health` → `{ "status": "ok" }`
- [ ] WIF configured or planned (no service account JSON keys)
- [ ] `docker` skill loaded for Dockerfile (multi-stage, non-root user)

## Reference Files

| File | Load When |
|------|-----------|
| `reference/cloud-run-functions.md` | Writing a Pub/Sub, Storage, or HTTP trigger function |
| `reference/cold-start-optimization.md` | Function is slow to start or you need `--cpu-boost` flags |
| `assets/cloud-run-antipatterns.md` | Reviewing any Cloud Run code or config for correctness |

---

## Cross-References

- **Dockerfiles**: Load `docker` skill → `reference/dockerfiles.md` for all 4 stack Dockerfiles
- **Cloud Run Service (long-running)**: Dispatch `deployment-engineer` agent
- **Terraform infrastructure**: Dispatch `terraform-specialist` agent
- **ADK agent on Cloud Run**: Use `adk-deploy-guide` skill (has ADK-specific Cloud Run patterns)
- **GitHub Actions pipeline**: `docs/workflows/deployment-ci-cd.md`
- **Security review (WIF, secrets)**: Dispatch `security-reviewer` agent after implementation
