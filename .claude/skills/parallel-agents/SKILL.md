## Iron Law

**USE THIS WORKSPACE'S ACTUAL AGENTS — never reference placeholder agents (security-auditor, backend-specialist) that don't exist here; always dispatch from the 42 agents in .claude/agents/**

**Explanation:** Dispatching a non-existent agent silently fails. Every agent name in this skill maps to a real .md file in .claude/agents/.

# Parallel Agents Orchestration

Orchestration guide for coordinating multiple specialized agents through Claude Code's native Agent tool. Keeps all orchestration within Claude's control using the built-in Agent tool and TeamCreate.

---

## When to Use Orchestration

**Good for:**
- Complex tasks requiring multiple expertise domains (security + code quality + tests)
- Comprehensive reviews (architecture + security + accessibility)
- Feature implementation needing backend + frontend + database work
- Full pre-deploy audits across all stack layers

**Not for:**
- Simple, single-domain tasks (use the relevant specialist agent directly)
- Quick fixes or small changes within one file
- Tasks where one agent suffices

**Decision rule:** If dispatching more than 1 agent, use this skill for orchestration patterns and synthesis protocol.

## Orchestration Patterns

Load `references/orchestration-patterns.md` for full pattern details.

### Pattern 1: Comprehensive Feature Review

For any feature touching security-sensitive code, database, or multiple services:

```
Step 1: code-reviewer          → overall quality gate
Step 2: [stack-specific reviewer] → framework-specific patterns
Step 3: security-reviewer      → OWASP + auth + input validation
Step 4: silent-failure-hunter  → error handling completeness
Step 5: pr-test-analyzer       → behavioral test coverage
Step 6: Synthesize all findings
```

### Pattern 2: Pre-Deploy Audit

Before merging any significant feature branch:

```
Parallel:
  security-reviewer     → security findings
  [stack reviewer]      → framework correctness
  pr-test-analyzer      → test coverage gaps
Sequential:
  output-evaluator      → APPROVE / NEEDS_REVIEW / REJECT verdict
```

### Pattern 3: Full Flutter Feature

```
riverpod-reviewer         → state management
flutter-security-expert   → secure storage, GDPR
accessibility-auditor     → WCAG 2.1
ui-standards-expert       → design tokens, touch targets
silent-failure-hunter     → error handling in async code
```

### Pattern 4: Agentic AI System Review

```
agentic-ai-reviewer       → graph correctness, guardrails
security-reviewer         → prompt injection, input validation
rag-pipeline-reviewer     → chunking, model pinning (if RAG used)
silent-failure-hunter     → tool error handling
```

## Synthesis Protocol

Load `references/synthesis-protocol.md` for the full template.

After all agents complete:

```markdown
## Orchestration Synthesis

### Task Summary
[What was accomplished]

### Agent Contributions
| Agent | Key Finding |
|-------|------------|
| [agent] | [finding] |

### Consolidated Recommendations (severity-ordered)
1. **CRITICAL** — [issue] — must fix before merge
2. **HIGH** — [issue] — should fix before merge
3. **MEDIUM** — [issue] — fix in follow-up PR
4. **LOW** — [issue] — note for tech debt backlog

### Verdict
[APPROVE | NEEDS_REVIEW | BLOCK] — based on finding severity
```

---

## Constraints

### MUST DO
- Only dispatch agents that exist in `.claude/agents/` (42 agents listed in catalog above)
- Pass explicit context to every agent — agents do NOT inherit CLAUDE.md or conversation history
- Produce a single synthesized report, not separate outputs per agent
- Include test coverage review (pr-test-analyzer) for any code-modifying orchestration

### MUST NOT DO
- Dispatch agents with only "review this code" — always pass specific context and scope
- Run more agents than needed — match agent count to actual coverage gaps
- Skip synthesis — raw agent outputs are not a deliverable
