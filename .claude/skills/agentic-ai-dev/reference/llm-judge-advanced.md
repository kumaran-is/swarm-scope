# LLM-as-Judge Advanced — Production Reliability & Bias Mitigation

> This file covers production-grade LLM-as-Judge techniques beyond the basic `evaluate_with_judge()` in `agentic-prompt-optimization.md`. Do NOT duplicate the basic judge — this file is exclusively about reliability and bias mitigation.

---

## Section 1: The Bias Landscape

| Bias Type | Description | Symptom | Mitigation |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| Position Bias | First-position response preferred | Response A always "wins" in pairwise | Position swap protocol — always evaluate twice |
| Length Bias | Longer responses rated higher | Verbose answers outscore concise ones | Explicit prompt: "Do NOT prefer based on length"; length-normalized scoring |
| Self-Enhancement Bias | Model rates own outputs higher | Claude judge rates Claude outputs better | Use different model for generation vs evaluation |
| Verbosity Bias | Detailed explanations score higher regardless of accuracy | Padded responses outperform terse correct ones | Criteria-specific rubrics that penalize irrelevant detail |
| Authority Bias | Confident/authoritative tone scores higher | Wrong confident answer beats correct hedged one | Require evidence citation; fact-checking layer |

## Section 6: Decision Framework — Direct vs Pairwise

```
Is there an objective ground truth or clear criteria?
+-- Yes -> Direct Scoring
|   Use: factual accuracy, instruction following, format compliance, groundedness
|   Scale: 1-5 with rubric for consistency; 1-10 only with 10 explicit level descriptions
|
+-- No -> Is it a preference or subjective quality judgment?
    +-- Yes -> Pairwise Comparison (use pairwise_with_swap above)
    |   Use: tone, style, persuasiveness, creativity, "which is better"
    |
    +-- No (reference available) -> Reference-Based Direct Scoring
        Use: summarization (vs source), translation (vs reference)
```

## Section 7: Common Anti-Patterns

| Anti-pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Score without justification | Unreliable, can't debug | Chain-of-thought: justification BEFORE score |
| Single-pass pairwise | Position bias corrupts | Always use pairwise_with_swap |
| Overloaded criteria | One criterion measuring 2+ things | Split: one criterion = one aspect |
| Missing edge case guidance | Inconsistent handling of ambiguous cases | Add edge_cases to rubric |
| High confidence + low evidence | Judge is overconfident | Flag when evidence list < 2 items |
| Using judge model = generation model | Self-enhancement bias | Different models for gen vs eval |

    model="gemini-3.1-flash",
    instruction="""You are a pairwise evaluator. ...(same criteria as above)...
Output format: JSON with winner ("A"/"B"/"tie"), confidence (0-1), reasoning.""",
    output_key="pass1_result",
)

pass2_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="pass2_judge",  # evaluates with SWAPPED positions
    model="gemini-3.1-flash",
    instruction="""...same but note: Response A here was Response B in pass 1...""",
    output_key="pass2_result",
)

consistency_checker = LlmAgent(
    name="consistency_checker",
    model="gemini-3.1-flash",
    instruction="""Read pass1_result and pass2_result from session state.
Remap pass2 winner (A->B, B->A, tie->tie).
If mapped winners agree: final_winner = that winner, confidence = average.
If they disagree: final_winner = "tie", confidence = 0.5.

pairwise_pipeline = SequentialAgent(
    name="pairwise_judge_pipeline",
    sub_agents=[pass1_agent, pass2_agent, consistency_checker],
