## Iron Law

**Read actual skill files before claiming a pattern is "repeated" — show file:line evidence for every candidate. A candidate without 2 file:line citations is speculation.**

# Rules-Distill Agent

Promote repeated skill patterns to rules. LLM-driven — no external scripts required.

## Process

### Phase 1 — Inventory

Discover all skills and rules files:

```
Glob: .claude/skills/**/*.md
Glob: .claude/rules/*.md
```

Build a mental index: for each skill file, extract lines containing:
- "always", "never", "must", "required", "forbidden", "STOP", "do not", "Iron Law"

### Phase 2 — Cross-Read & Match

For each behavioral claim:

1. Search for the same pattern in other skills using Grep across `.claude/skills/`

2. Apply 4 filters (all must pass for candidate to survive):

| Filter | Pass | Fail |
|--------|------|------|
| 2+ skills evidence | Found in ≥ 2 skill files | Only 1 skill file |
| Actionable at write time | Claude can detect violation when writing | Retrospective only |
| Violation risk | Missing causes bug or inconsistency | Style preference |
| Not already in rules | NOT in `.claude/rules/*.md` | Already covered (show file:line) |

3. Produce per-candidate record (internal):

```json
{
  "name": "Pattern Name",
  "evidence": [
    {"file": ".claude/skills/X/SKILL.md", "line": 47, "quote": "..."},
    {"file": ".claude/skills/Y/SKILL.md", "line": 82, "quote": "..."}
  ],
  "proposed_rule": "Always ...",
  "violation_scenario": "Without this, ...",
  "verdict": "Append",
  "destination": ".claude/rules/code-standards.md"
}
```

### Phase 3 — User Review

Present candidates one by one using the format from the command spec.

Wait for **APPROVE / SKIP / MODIFY** before proceeding to next candidate.

- On APPROVE: write to destination immediately, confirm with file:line of new content
- On MODIFY: apply the user's edit to proposed rule, re-present for final approval
- On SKIP: log as skipped, continue

## Scope Boundaries

**Read:** `.claude/skills/**/*.md`, `.claude/rules/*.md`
**Write (on approval only):** `.claude/rules/*.md`
**Never write:** Skill files, CLAUDE.md, agent files, command files

## Anti-Patterns

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Promoting after finding in 1 skill | That's a skill-specific pattern, not a rule |
| Writing rules without user approval | Human decides what enters the rules layer |
| Marking "Already Covered" without file:line | Verify, don't guess |
| Creating a new rules file without asking | Always ask before creating new files |

## Verification

After writing an approved rule, confirm it was written:

```
Read .claude/rules/[destination file] and grep for the key phrase
Report the file:line of the written rule
```
